title: "[Archive] Moving to GitHub Pages!"

Edit 6th of August: Sorry for another change this quick. I sort of managed to setup the server "right" this time, so the migration is postponed (canceled?) indefinitely. We're staying on this self-hosted WordPress instance. All data is still intact, the content below only serves archival purposes. :)

Hello everyone, long story short. To share my experience more efficiently without having to care too much about the security/maintenance/performance of the site, I've decided to move the Crunchy Studio page to GitHub pages until **mid-August**.

All content will be transferred, excluding user comments. User accounts and data will become irrelevant as account-related features (mainly for commenting) will be provided by GitHub in the future. Your user account/data, which was stored on on-prem servers, will therefore be deleted after the migration.

The site might be temporarily (1-2 days) unavailable during the migration. Until the final migration begins, this site will still operate as-is. I will try to make the transition as seemless as possible. **If the site displays/behaves incorrectly after the migration, you can try to clear your browser cache and cookies for this site.**

Thank you for supporting this little project of mine!
